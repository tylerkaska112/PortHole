### What this is
Porthole runs Windows games on iPhone and iPad using the Madeira runtime (Wine, FEX, DXMT). It is unofficial, not affiliated with Valve, Microsoft, Apple or any game publisher, and does not bypass any licence check. The IPA is **unsigned**: you sign and install it yourself (see the README). Source: see docs/SOURCE.md in the repository (the exact versions of everything it is built from are listed there).

Licence: GPL-3.0-or-later with an additional permission for the Apple Metal Shader Converter (LICENSE, LICENSE-EXCEPTION.md); third-party licences and credits are in the app under Settings > About > Licences.

SHA-256 of the IPA: \`$(cut -d' ' -f1 "$IPA.sha256")\`
