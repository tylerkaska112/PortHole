# Puts a built PUBLIC IPA on the public update channel of the Hub, signed, so installs of the public build are offered it as an update.
#
#   tools/promote_public.sh [--hub-hosted] [--skip-check] [path/to/Porthole-<version>-<build>.ipa]      default: the newest IPA in dist/public
#   HUB_DATA=/tmp/scratch-hub tools/promote_public.sh ...                 publishes to a scratch folder instead (use this to test)
#
# Where installs download the IPA from: its GitHub release asset (PUBLIC_SOURCE_URL/releases/download/v<version>/<file>), so the Hub only serves the small
# update files and none of its bandwidth. The asset must already be uploaded; unless --skip-check, it is downloaded here and compared with the IPA first,
# because a wrong address would strand every install. --hub-hosted serves the IPA from the Hub instead.
#
# The IPA must be the one tools/release_public.sh built (the same file that is uploaded to GitHub), so the checksum on the Hub is the checksum on GitHub.
# The channel is PUBLIC_HUB_APP_ID from tools/local.env (default "porthole-stable"); it is NOT the maintainer's own channel, which tools/release.sh publishes
# to. Publishing is state-changing: it writes into the Hub's data folder, and every public install can see the build the moment it is there.
